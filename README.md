# Addon Config Sync

Sync add-on `meta.json` configs across devices by storing copies in Anki's media folder and syncing those through AnkiWeb.

## Open the manager

Main window → Tools → **Manage Addon Configs**

This is the main UI for all operations.

## What the manager shows

- One row per known add-on config (installed add-ons with `meta.json`, and media-only configs for not-installed add-ons).
- Status per row:
  - **Changed**: installed `meta.json` differs from media copy (click status to view diff + modified times).
  - **Not installed**: config exists in media but add-on is not installed locally.
  - **Updated**: config was overwritten in this Anki session.
  - **Up to date**: no relevant difference.

## Per-add-on and bulk actions

Each row supports:

- Save to local media (addon → media)
- Overwrite from local media (media → addon)
- Remove from local media
- Install add-on (when not installed)
- Ignore toggle

Top action buttons apply to selected rows (with shift-range select support).

## Filtering and sorting

- Filter by add-on name.
- Filter by status dimensions (Changed / Installed / Updated).
- Filter by Ignore state.
- Header sorting supports Addon, Status, and Ignore columns with ascending/descending/none cycling.

## Sync modes

Set in the manager dialog (radio buttons):

1. **Update configs on Sync** (default)
   - During normal sync, changed local addon configs are saved to media before media sync.
   - Downloaded media config changes are applied automatically to installed addons after media sync.
   - Ignored addons are skipped.

2. **Update configs on Sync, show summary**
   - Same behavior as mode 1.
   - After sync, opens the manager dialog **only if at least one addon config was updated**.

3. **Ask about changes to configs**
   - Still saves local changes to media on sync.
   - Does **not** auto-overwrite addon configs from downloaded media.
   - Opens the manager dialog non-blocking, prefiltered to changed or not-installed entries.
   - Ignored addons are skipped.

## Sync now button

The manager includes **Sync now**, which triggers Anki sync in download-focused mode for this add-on flow and refreshes statuses when sync finishes.

## Notes

- Some add-ons may require an Anki restart after config overwrite.
- The first device to upload a conflicting media config generally wins on subsequent device syncs.
